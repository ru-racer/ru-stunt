Learning professional stunt maneuvers for emergency situations.

We are developing a safe control policy search for autonomous J-turn maneuvers inspired by professional car drivers. These drivers have been highly trained to achieve highly aggressive J-turn maneuvers that can be used as potential vehicle safety strategies in emergency situations. We take advantage of this knowledge by integrating an expertâ€™s instruction into reinforcement learning design. The proposed safe reinforcement learning method uses constrained Markov decision processing to find a risk-free control policy for autonomous J-turn maneuver. The proposed algorithms realize the control of continuous action as a sequence of policies with safety constraints. We demonstrate experimentally the development of policy design for the safe J-turn maneuver from simulations to real-world applications.
